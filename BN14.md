If you played Exponential Idle start with the idea that BN14 will be very similar to the Lemmas from that game.

BN14 will consist of a series of mathematical equation that needs optimizing. BN14 can only be completed by obtaining enough currency from the equations. It also has no levels as the reward is based on how fast you can complete it.

Each equation contains several variable that can be upgraded by spending currency specific to BN14

Let's imagine a very simple equation

`delta p = c1/|e-c2/c3|`
(c1 div absolute value of the natural constant e minus c2/c3)

`delta p` is the amount of currency you earn every tick
`c1`, `c2`, `c3` are all variables that the player can upgrade in exchange for the `p` currency

`c2` and `c3` increase by `1` every level and the cost to upgrade is exponential
`c1` increases exponentially and the cost to upgrade is also exponential

So the goal here is to generate as much currency as possible. For this particular equation the goal is to increase `c1` as much as possible but also to make `c2/c3` as close to `e` as possible.

An equation like this represents one part of the BN. Players will be presented with MANY different equations.

Every equation contributes to completing the BN faster.

I need equations that test many different aspect of "math culture", it can be chaos theory, quantum mechanic, weird polynomials, etc.
