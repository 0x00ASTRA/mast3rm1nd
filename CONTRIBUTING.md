# Contributing to BitBurner

## In General
The game is made better because the community as a whole speaks up about
ways to improve the game. Here's some of the ways you can make your voice
heard:
 - [Discord](https://discordapp.com)
   There is a dedicated Discord instance set up for more free-form chats
   between all members of the community. Regular players, heavy scripters,
   BitBurner contributors, and everyone in between can be found on the
   server.
 - [Github Issues](https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/issues)
   Although the term "issues" can have a negative connotation, they are a
   means of communicating with the community. A new Issue can be a
   interesting new feature that you feel would improve the game. It could be
   an unexpected behavior within the game. Or because the game is about
   scripting perhaps there is something that is conflicting with the
   browser's Javascript interaction. So please do not be afraid to open a
   [new issue](https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/issues/new).
