Getting Started Guide for Beginner Programmers
==============================================

.. note:: Note that the scripts and strategies given in this guide aren't necessarily
          optimal. They're just meant to introduce you to the game and help you get
          started.

This is an introductory guide to getting started with Bitburner. It is not meant to be a
comprehensive guide for the entire game, only the early stages. If you are confused
or overwhelmed by the game, especially the programming and scripting aspects, this
guide is perfect for you!

Note that this guide is tailored towards those with minimal programming experience.

Introduction
------------
Bitburner is a cyberpunk-themed incremental RPG. The player progresses by raising
their :ref:`gameplay_stats`, earning money, and :ref:`climbing the corporate ladder <gameplay_companies>`.
Eventually, after reaching certain criteria, the player will begin receiving invitations
from :ref:`gameplay_factions`. Joining these factions and working for them will unlock
:ref:`gameplay_augmentations`. Purchasing and installing Augmentations provide persistent
upgrades and are necessary for progressing in the game.

The game has a minimal story/quest-line that can be followed to reach the end of the game.
Since this guide is only about getting started with Bitburner, it will not cover the
entire "quest-line".

First Steps
-----------
I'm going to assume you followed the introductory tutorial when you first began the game.
In this introductory tutorial you created a script called `foodnstuff.script` and ran it
on the `foodnstuff` server. Right now, we'll kill this script. There are two ways
to do this:

1. You can go to the Terminal and enter::

    $ kill foodnstuff.script

2. You can go to the "Active Scripts" page (:ref:`Keyboard shortcut <shortcuts>` Alt + s) and
   press the "Kill Script" button for `foodnstuff.script`.

If you skipped the introductory tutorial, then ignore the part above. Instead, go to the
"Hacknet Nodes" page (:ref:`Keyboard shortcut <shortcuts>` Alt + h) and purchase a
Hacknet Node to start generating some passive income.
