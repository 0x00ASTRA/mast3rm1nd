## NS.tail() method

Opens a script’s logs. This is functionally the same as the tail Terminal command.

If the function is called with no arguments, it will open the current script’s logs.

Otherwise, the fn, hostname/ip, and args… arguments can be used to get the logs from another script. Remember that scripts are uniquely identified by both their names and arguments.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
tail(fn?: Script, host?: Host, ...args: any[]): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  fn | [Script](./bitburner.script.md) | Optional. Filename of the script being tailed. If omitted, the current script is tailed. |
|  host | [Host](./bitburner.host.md) | Optional. Hostname or IP of the script being tailed. Defaults to the server this script is running on. If args are specified, this is not optional. |
|  args | any\[\] | Arguments for the script being tailed. |

<b>Returns:</b>
