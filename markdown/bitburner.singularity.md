This function can also be used to apply for promotions by specifying the company and field you are already employed at.<!-- -->This function will return true if you successfully get a job/promotion, and false otherwise.

Instead, I would use the isBusy Singularity function to check whether you have finished attempting a crime. This is because although the game sets a certain crime to be X amount of seconds, there is no guarantee that your browser will follow that time limit. |
