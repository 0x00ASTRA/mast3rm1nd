## Port type

Queue used to send and receive messages.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
type Port = number;
```

## Remarks

A port is implemented as a sort of serialized queue, where you can only write and read one element at a time from the port. When you read data from a port, the element that is read is removed from the port.

IMPORTANT: The data inside ports are not saved! This means if you close and re-open the game, or reload the page then you will lose all of the data in the ports!
