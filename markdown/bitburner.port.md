## Port type

A port is implemented as a sort of serialized queue, where you can only write and read one element at a time from the port. When you read data from a port, the element that is read is removed from the port.

IMPORTANT: The data inside ports are not saved! This means if you close and re-open the game, or reload the page then you will lose all of the data in the ports!

```typescript
type Port = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20;
```
