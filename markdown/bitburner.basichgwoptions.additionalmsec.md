## BasicHGWOptions.additionalMsec property

Number of additional milliseconds that will be spent waiting between the start of the function and when it completes. There will only be one, contiguous wait, which is relevant because stats such as server security level are computed at the \*start\* of the function. Must be non-negative.

**Signature:**

```typescript
additionalMsec?: number;
```
