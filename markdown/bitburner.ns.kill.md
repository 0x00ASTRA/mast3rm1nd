## NS.kill() method

Kills the script on the target server specified by the script’s name and arguments. Remember that scripts are uniquely identified by both their name and arguments. For example, if \`<!-- -->foo.script<!-- -->\` is run with the argument 1, then this is not the same as \`<!-- -->foo.script<!-- -->\` run with the argument 2, even though they have the same code.

```typescript
kill(script: Script, host: Host, ...args: string[]): boolean;
```
