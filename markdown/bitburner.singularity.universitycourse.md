## Singularity.universityCourse() method

If you are not in BitNode-4, then you must have Level 1 of Source-File 4 in order to use this function and the RAM cost is doubled.

This function will automatically set you to start taking a course at a university. If you are already in the middle of some “working” action (such as working at a company, for a faction, or on a program), then running this function will automatically cancel that action and give you your earnings.

The cost and experience gains for all of these universities and classes are the same as if you were to manually visit and take these classes.
