## Singularity.gymWorkout() method

If you are not in BitNode-4, then you must have Level 1 of Source-File 4 in order to use this function and the RAM cost is doubled.

This function will automatically set you to start working out at a gym to train a particular stat. If you are already in the middle of some “working” action (such as working at a company, for a faction, or on a program), then running this function will automatically cancel that action and give you your earnings.

The cost and experience gains for all of these gyms are the same as if you were to manually visit these gyms and train

<b>Signature:</b>
